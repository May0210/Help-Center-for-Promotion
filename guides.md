Elements for Making Playable Material (selected):

Upload pictures, audios, videos, or other elements of your app as much as you can, so that we can create the best playable materials for you. In two ways you can upload your elements. The first way is selecting files directly, which suits for files of small size. The second way is adding online links, such as Drop Box, Google Drive, Sky Drive, Baidu Cloud Drive etc. When you have files of large amount and big size, this way would suits you well. The elements you uploaded will be stored in Material Library. (About Material Library, see in 2.4)
